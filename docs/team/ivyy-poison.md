### Project: HRMate

HRMate is a desktop address book application that aims to streamline HR processes, by offering an intuitive, CLI-based
contact management system with specialised functionalities for HR tasks. It has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is
written in Java with about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* User Guide
  * Add documentation for the following commands: `find-leave-range`, `find-leave-status`, `find-all-leave`
    `find-leave` and `delete-leave`

* Feature Development
  * Develop the delete-tag command
  * Improve code coverage of code base by implementing unit tests
  * Build Leave, LeavesBook and LeavesBookStorage classes and integrated them into the
    existing code base
