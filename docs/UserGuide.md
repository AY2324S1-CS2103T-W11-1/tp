# HRMate User Guide

HRMate is a **desktop app for managing employee records, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HRMate can get your contact management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `hrmate.jar` from [to be updated]().

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HRMate.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hrmate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.
   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

    performing these actions, especially if you are a new user!

## How to interpret command formats

Example command format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

This command is used to add an employee to the address book. Let's examine how we can use this command.

| **Command component examples** | **What they mean**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add                            | The name of the command. It is the first word of the command. You must specify the command that you intend to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| n/NAME                         | Command fields. We use these fields to supply further information that the command requires, in this case, the employee's name. Fields are separated by a space. Some fields require a field prefix, while other fields do not have a field prefix. Let's look at the field in greater detail.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| n/                             | Field prefix. It contains a letter followed by a forward slash (/). If the field has a field prefix, the prefix must be specified at the start of the field. Each of these fields has a unique prefix, which can be found by referring to the command format (e.g. n/ for the name field, p/ for the phone number field). Additionally, fields with field prefixes can be written in any order, so long as they are written after fields without field prefixes. |
| NAME                           | Field name. For field names that contain more than one word, they are separated by an underscore, e.g. PHONE_NUMBER. We can replace this with information specific to our scenario. For instance, if we add an employee named *John Smith*, we will type in the field as `n/John Smith`, where *John Smith* replaces NAME.                                                                                                                                       |
| [t/TAG]                        | Optional command fields. Fields wrapped in square brackets i.e. [] are optional and need not be filled in for the command to succeed. Nevertheless, if you want to supply this field to the command, follow the format specified within the square brackets. For instance, if we want to provide a tag (e.g. *manager*) an optional field, we will key in the field as `t/manager`.                                                                              |
| ...                            | The ellipsis following a field indicates that we can supply any number of that particular field, with each field separated by a space. In the example, [t/TAG]... means we can provide any number of tags in the command. For instance, if we want to provide the tags *manager* and *sales*, we can key them in as `t/manager t/sales`.                                                                                                                         |
**Notes**
* Parameters can be in any order <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
  acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

    specified by including its associated field prefix in the command (i.e. `n/` for name, `p/` for phone number etc.)
  * For the name, phone number, email address and home address fields: If these fields are included in the command, they
    cannot be left empty (e.g. `n/` is not allowed as the new name cannot be empty)
* **Warning:**
    <box type="warning" seamless>
    If the tag prefix is specified, all existing tags currently associated with the employee will be removed and
    replaced with the new tags specified in the command, if any (see examples 2 and 3 above). Therefore, to avoid losing
    any tags associated with the employee, we recommend using the [add-tag](#adding-tags-to-employees-add-tag) and [delete-tag](#removing-tags-from-employees-delete-tag) commands instead for
    greater control.
    </box>
* **Expected output on failure:**
  * `At least one field to edit must be provided` - if no fields are provided
  * `The person index provided is invalid` - if the index provided does not match with any employee in the displayed
    person list
  * `FIELD must be of format...` - if at least one of the field inputs violates the field's format requirements. Follow
    the displayed error message to fix the format error.
* **For advanced users:**
  * You can remove all the tags of an employee with `edit INDEX t/` (see example 2 above)

### Viewing All Tags: `view-tag`

* **What It Does:**
  * Shows a list of all tags currently in use within the address book, which helps HR managers quickly identify different categories of employees.

* **Format:**

### Adding tags to employees: `add-tag`


* **What It Does:**
  * Adds a tag to an employee record, useful for classifying employees like 'remote', 'contract', etc.

* **Format:**
  * `add-tag EMPLOYEE_LIST_INDEX TAG`
* **Examples:**

| S/N | Command information                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Command:** `add-tag 3 t/remote` <br><br> **Output:** Adds the tag “remote” to the employee whose index is 3. For instance, if “Paolo Maldini” is the employee whose index is 3, Maldini’s record will now contain the tag “remote”.        |
| 2   | **Command:** `add-tag 14 t/temp t/contract` <br><br> **Output:** Adds the tag “temp” “contract” to the employee whose index is 14. For instance, if “Thierry Henry” is the employee whose index is 14, Henry’s record will now contain the tags “temp” and “contract”  |

* **Acceptable Values:**
  * Employee List Index: A unique identifier corresponding to a row entry shown in the address book. It must be a valid number and cannot exceed the number of entries in the address book.
  * Tag: A non-empty string used to categorise and label an employee. Tags names only allows alphanumeric characters, spaces, and dashes. (e.g., remote, contract-worker, full time). They are also case-sensitive, so “friend” and “Friend” are different tags.
* **Expected Output on Success:**
  * GUI Changes: The employee's record shows the new tag.
  * Message shown to the user: "Edited Person: ..." followed by the person's updated information
* **Expected Output on Failure:**
  * `The employee index provided is invalid` - An invalid index was specified
  * `This employee already has some of the tags.` - The specified tag already exists in the employee's record
  * `Invalid command format!...` followed by command information - There were missing parameters in command

### Removing tags from employees: `delete-tag`

* **What It Does:**
  * Removes a tag from an employee record. This is used when an employee's category changes or the tag no longer applies.

* **Format:**
  * `delete-tag EMPLOYEE_LIST_INDEX TAG`
* **Examples:**

| S/N | Command information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Command:** `delete-tag 5 t/remote` <br><br> **Output:** Removes the tag “remote” from the employee whose index is 5. For instance, if “Rio Ferdinand” is the employee whose index is 5, the tag “remote” will be removed from Ferdinand’s record.          |
| 2   | **Command:** `delete-tag 7 t/contract t/temp` <br><br> **Output:** Removes the tag “contract” and "temp" from the employee whose index is 7. For instance, if “Cristiano Ronaldo” is the employee whose index is 7, the tag “contract” and "temp" will be removed from Ronaldo’s record.  |

* **Acceptable Values:**
  * Employee List Index: A unique identifier corresponding to a row entry shown in the address book. It must be a valid number and cannot exceed the number of entries in the address book.
  * Tag: A non-empty string used to categorise and label an employee. Tags names only allows alphanumeric characters, spaces, and dashes. (e.g., remote, contract-worker, full time). They are also case-sensitive, so “friend” and “Friend” are different tags.
* **Expected Output on Success:**
  * GUI Changes: The employee's record is updated to remove the deleted tag.
  * Message shown to the user: "Tag [Tag] removed from [Employee name]."
* **Expected Output on Failure:**
  * `The employee index provided is invalid` - An invalid index was specified
  * `Some of the tags are not found on this employee.` - The specified tag does not exist in the employee's record
  * `Invalid command format!...` followed by command information - There were missing parameters in command




### Finding employees with all tags in a group of tags: `find-all-tag`


* **What It Does:**
  * Filters and displays individuals from a dataset who match all the specified tags (case-sensitive) exactly. It helps users narrow their search to find records meeting all the specified criteria.

* **Format:**
  * `find-all-tag t/TAG [t/MORE_TAGS]...`
* **Examples:**


| S/N | Command information                                                                                                                      |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Importing/Exporting employee records
It's painful having to add in each employee into HRMate manually. That's why HRMate provides import and export commands,
so you can bring in all your records from Excel with just a single command!

With the import and export commands, HRMate can read and save files in [CSV](#glossary) format, which is supported
by major spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel. 


#### Importing employee records : `import`

Here's how you can bring over your records from Excel:

1. Export your Excel save file in CSV format. Ensure that the separator is set to be a semicolon(`;`), and that you have
the following fields: Name, Phone, Email, Address. You may also include a Tags column if you wish.
   * You may skip this step if you already have a CSV file (e.g. you are importing a previously exported CSV file generated by
   HRMate)
2. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `import`
3. In the file dialog that opens up, go to where you saved your exported CSV file, click on it, and click on the Open button.
4. You should see your employee records show up in HRMate, along with the message "Employee records have been imported from [your file name]!"

Here are some possible error messages you might encounter and here's how you can fix them:

| Error Message                                                       | Why it happens                                                               | Fix                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Exporting employee records : `export`

Not only can you bring your data into HRMate, you can also bring your data out of HRMate. HRMate's export feature allows you
to export either the entire set of employee records, or employee records with a particular filter applied (e.g. only export
all full-time employees, which are tagged with "Full time"). You can then either store your exported CSV file for future use,
open it in a different application, or send it to another employee for them to import!

Here's how you can export your data out of HRMate:

1. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `export [file name]`, replacing `[file name]` with the name
you will like to give your file. Your files will be saved in CSV format automatically.
   - For instance, if you would like to save your file as  `employees.csv`, type in the command `export employees`
2. You should see the message "Employee records have been saved to [file name]!"
3. To retrieve your exported file, go to the folder in which HRMate is stored in your File Explorer (if using Windows) or
Finder (if using Mac OS). From there, click on the `export` folder.
4. You should see your file in the `export` folder.

Here are potential error messages that you may receive and here's how to fix them:

| Error Message                                                       | Why it happens                                   | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Employee records could not be saved!                                | You do not have the permission to write the file | Try renaming your file name when typing out the command, especially if the previous name refers to an existing file. If not, move HRMate to a different folder where you can create files, and run the command again. |

### Importing/Exporting leave records
The import and export feature extends to importing and exporting leaves. This allows you to generate lists of leave
applications that can be opened in other major spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel.


#### Importing employee records : `import-leave`

Here's how you can bring over your leave records from Excel:

1. Export your Excel save file in CSV format. Ensure that the separator is set to be a semicolon(`;`), and that you have
   the following fields: Title, Employee, Start, End, Description, Status.
  * You may skip this step if you already have a CSV file (e.g. you are importing a previously exported CSV file generated by
    HRMate)
2. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `import-leave`
3. In the file dialog that opens up, go to where you saved your exported CSV file, click on it, and click on the Open button.
4. You should see your leave records show up in HRMate, along with the message "Leave records have been imported from [your file name]!"

Here are some possible error messages you might encounter and here's how you can fix them:

| Error Message                                                       | Why it happens                                                            | Fix                                                                               |

| No valid records found in file [file name], import cancelled        | Your file either is empty or does not contain a single valid leave record | Ensure that your file is non-empty and fulfils the abovementioned constraints     |                                                     


#### Exporting leave records : `export-leave`

Not only can you bring your data into HRMate, you can also bring your data out of HRMate. HRMate's export feature allows you
to export either the entire set of leave application records, or leave records with a particular filter applied (e.g. only export
all leaves in a given time period). You can then either store your exported CSV file for future use,
open it in a different application, or send it to another employee for them to import!

Here's how you can export your data out of HRMate:

1. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `export-leave [file name]`, replacing `[file name]` with the name
   you will like to give your file. Your files will be saved in CSV format automatically.
  - For instance, if you would like to save your file as  `today.csv`, type in the command `export today`
2. You should see the message "Leave records have been saved to [file name]!"
3. To retrieve your exported file, go to the folder in which HRMate is stored in your File Explorer (if using Windows) or
   Finder (if using Mac OS). From there, click on the `export` folder.
4. You should see your file in the `export` folder.

Here are potential error messages that you may receive and here's how to fix them:

|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Leave records could not be saved! | You do not have the permission to write the file | Try renaming your file name when typing out the command, especially if the previous name refers to an existing file.

### Saving the data

HRMate data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HRMate data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/hrmate.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

* **Warning:**
  <box type="warning" seamless>
    If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HRMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
  </box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HRMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
