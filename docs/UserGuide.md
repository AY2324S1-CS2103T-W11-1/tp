# HRMate User Guide

HRMate is a **desktop app for managing employee records, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HRMate can get your contact management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `hrmate.jar` from [to be updated]().

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HRMate.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hrmate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.
   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## How to interpret command formats

Example command format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

This command is used to add an employee to the address book. Let's examine how we can use this command.

| **Command component examples** | **What they mean**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| add                            | The name of the command. It is the first word of the command. You must specify the command that you intend to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| n/NAME                         | Command fields. We use these fields to supply further information that the command requires, in this case, the employee's name. Fields are separated by a space. Some fields require a field prefix, while other fields do not have a field prefix. Let's look at the field in greater detail.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| n/                             | Field prefix. It contains a letter followed by a forward slash (/). If the field has a field prefix, the prefix must be specified at the start of the field. Each of these fields has a unique prefix, which can be found by referring to the command format (e.g. n/ for the name field, p/ for the phone number field). Additionally, fields with field prefixes can be written in any order, so long as they are written after fields without field prefixes. |
| NAME                           | Field name. For field names that contain more than one word, they are separated by an underscore, e.g. PHONE_NUMBER. We can replace this with information specific to our scenario. For instance, if we add an employee named *John Smith*, we will type in the field as `n/John Smith`, where *John Smith* replaces NAME.                                                                                                                                       |
| [t/TAG]                        | Optional command fields. Fields wrapped in square brackets i.e. [] are optional and need not be filled in for the command to succeed. Nevertheless, if you want to supply this field to the command, follow the format specified within the square brackets. For instance, if we want to provide a tag (e.g. *manager*) an optional field, we will key in the field as `t/manager`.                                                                              |
| ...                            | The ellipsis following a field indicates that we can supply any number of that particular field, with each field separated by a space. In the example, [t/TAG]... means we can provide any number of tags in the command. For instance, if we want to provide the tags *manager* and *sales*, we can key them in as `t/manager t/sales`.                                                                                                                         |
**Notes**
* Parameters can be in any order <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also
  acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Features

### Getting help
Should you need any help, you can access this online user guide (this document) with the `help` [command](#glossary).

#### Getting help : `help`

1. Type in the following command in the [command box](#glossary): `help`. 
2. Press "Enter" on your keyboard.
3. The following pop up should show:
![help menu](images/help-menu.png)

4. Click on the "copy link" button to copy the link to the user guide, and paste into any [web browser](#glossary) to access the user guide. Alternatively, click the red button at the corner of the window to close the pop up.

### Adding a new employee
When a new employee joins, you can use the `add` [command](#glossary) to add their information into HRMate.

#### Adding an employee: `add`

1. Type in the following [command](#glossary) in the [command box](#glossary): `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS a/HOME_ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`, replace `NAME` with employee name, `PHONE_NUMBER` with employee phone number `EMAIL_ADDRESS` with employee email address and `HOME_ADDRESS` with employee home address. `[t/TAG]...` is an optional field with one or more [tags](#glossary), with `TAG` being the name of the tag.
 - For instance, if you have an employee name John Doe with phone number 98765432, email johnd@example.com, home address John Street, block 123 #01-01 and tags full-time and remote, type in the command `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123 #01-01 t/full-time t/remote`
 - If your employee does not require any tags, using the same information as above, the command would be `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123 #01-01`
2. Press "enter" on your keyboard and you should see the person information at the end of the [employee list](#glossary).

### Editing employee records
HRMate offers different [commands](#glossary) for editing employee records. `add-tag` and `delete-tag` would add and remove an employee's [tags](#glossary) while `edit` is for editing name, phone number, email address, home address and tags.

#### Adding tags to employees : `add-tag`

1. Find the employee under the [employee list](#glossary).

<box type="info" seamless>
If the employee is not found, consider using <a href="">list</a> or any <a href="">find commands</a> to locate the employee in the employee list.
</box>

2. Type in the following [command](#glossary) in the [command box](#glossary) `add-tag INDEX t/TAG...` where `INDEX` is the [index](#glossary) of the employee in the list currently, `TAG` is the name of the [tag](#glossary) to be added and `t/TAG...` representing one or more tags. 
 - For instance, if you want to add the tags full-time and remote to the employee indexed 2, type `add-tag 2 t/full-time t/remote` to the command box.
3. Press "enter" on your keyboard and you should see the input tags added to the employee specified.

Here are the potential error messages that you may receive and here's how to fix them:

For example, for an employee who already has the full-time tag, the command `add-tag 2 t/full-time t/remote` would not work. Instead try `add-tag 2 t/remote`.                 |
| `Tags names only allows alphanumeric characters, spaces, and dashes.` | The tags input contains illegal characters                            | Remove the illegal characters from the input.                                                                                                                                                                                           |


#### Removing tags from employees : `delete-tag`
1. Get the [index](#glossary) of the employee in the [employee list](#glossary).

<box type="info" seamless>
If the employee is not found, consider using [list]() or any [find commands]() to locate the employee in the employee list.
</box>

2. Type in the following [command](#glossary) in the [command box](#glossary) `delete-tag INDEX t/TAG...` where `INDEX` is the index of the employee in the list currently, `TAG` is the name of the [tag](#glossary) to be deleted and `t/TAG...` representing one or more tags. 
 - For instance, if you want to remove the tags full-time and remote to the employee indexed 2, type `delete-tag 2 t/full-time t/remote` to the command box.
3. Press "enter" on your keyboard and you should see the input tags removed from the employee specified.

#### Editing the name, phone number, email address, home address or tags of employees : `edit`
1. Get the [index](#glossary) of the employee under the [employee list](#glossary).

<box type="info" seamless>
If the employee is not found, consider using <a href="">list</a> or any <a href="">find commands</a> to locate the employee in the employee list.
</box>

2. Type in the following [command](#glossary) in the [command box](#glossary) `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...` where `INDEX` is the index of the employee in the list currently, `[n/NAME]`, `[p/PHONE_NUMBER]`, `[e/EMAIL_ADDRESS]`, `[a/HOME_ADDRESS]` are optional fields which require changing, replacing `NAME` with employee name, `PHONE_NUMBER` with employee phone number, `EMAIL_ADDRESS` with employee email address and `HOME_ADDRESS` with employee home address. `[t/TAG]...` is an optional field representing one or more [tags](#glossary) where `TAG` is the tag name. Note that at least one field to edit must be present and only the fields present will be edited.
 - For example, to change the phone number, email address and tags of the employee indexed 2 to 98765432, johndoe@example.com and full-time and remote, type in the command `edit 2 p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com t/full-time t/remote`. Note that the name and home address will remain unchanged.
 - In another example, to change the home address of the employee indexed 1 to John street, block 123 #01-01 and remove all tags from the employee, type in the command `edit 1 a/John street, block 123 #01-01 t/`. Note that the name, phone number and email_address will remain unchanged.


<box type="warning" seamless>
If the tag prefix is specified, all existing tags under the employee will be removed and replaced with the new tags in the command.
In the first example, the employee will have all tags removed and replaced by 2 tags: full-time and remote.
In the second example, the employee will have all tags removed. No tags will be added since no tags are specified.
Therefore, to avoid unintentionally losing any information while editing tags, we recommend using the <a href="#adding-tags-to-employees--add-tag">add tag</a> and <a href="#removing-tags-from-employees--delete-tag">delete-tag</a> commands instead for editing tags.
</box>

3. Press "enter" on your keyboard and you should see the changes applied to the employee.

  * `The leave index provided is invalid` - if the index provided does not match with any employee record in the displayed leave list
  * `Invalid command format!... ` - if any of the required field missing
  * `Leave titles should only contain...` - if the title input is empty or invalid
  * `End date cannot be before start date` - the end date provided is before the current or provided start date


### Editing a leave record: `edit-leave`
* **What It Does:**
  * Edits an existing leave record in HRMate based on their index

* **Format:**
  * `edit-leave INDEX [title/TITLE] [start/START_DATE] [end/END_DATE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [s/STATUS]`
    
* Examples:

| S/N | Command information |
|-----|------|
| 1   | **Command:** `edit-leave 1 title/medical leave start/2023-11-01` <br> **Output**: Edits the leave record with index 1 to have the below changes: <ul><li>Title: medical leave</li><li>Start date: 2023 November 1st</li><li>No changes to the other fields</li></ul> |
| 2   | **Command:** `edit-leave 2 end/2023-11-02 d/not free until 11pm s/APPROVED` <br> **Output**: Edits the leave record with index 2 to have the below changes: <ul><li>End date: 2023 November 2nd</li><li>Description: not free until 11pm</li><li>Status: APPROVED</li></ul> |

  * The specified `INDEX` must match with a leave record shown in the displayed leave list.
  * At least one leave record's field must be changed (`edit-leave 1` would be invalid as no leave record field are changed)
  * Only fields specified will be modified; fields not specified in the command will not be modified. A field is specified by including its associated field prefix in the command (i.e. `title/` for title, `start/` for start date etc.)
  * For title: if this field is included in the command, it cannot be left empty (i.e. `title/` is not allowed)
  * For start and end: if these fields are included in the command, they must be in the format yyyy-mm-dd (like 2023-11-01 for 2023 November 1st). Additionally, the start date must be before or equals to the end date.
  * For status: if this field is included in the command, it must be either APPROVED, PENDING or REJECTED

* **Expected output on failure:**
  * `At least one field to edit must be provided` - if no fields are provided
  * `The leave index provided is invalid` - if the index provided does not match with any leave record in the displayed leave list
  * `FIELD must be of format...` - if at least one of the field inputs violates the field's format requirements. Follow the displayed error message to fix the format error.
  * `end date cannot be before start date` - the end date provided is before the current or provided start date

### Removing a leave record: `delete-leave`

If you wish to remove a leave record from HRMate, you can use the `delete-leave` command to do so.

1. Type in the following [command](#glossary) in the [command box](#glossary): `delete-leave LEAVE_LIST_INDEX`, and replace `LEAVE_LIST_INDEX` with the index of the leave record you wish to remove.
  - For instance: if you wanted to remove the leave record titled "medical leave" with employee "David de Gea", you would type in `delete-leave 1` in the command box.
  - Do note that the index of the leave record you wish to remove must be a valid number
    - The index must be a positive number that is larger than 0
    - The index cannot exceed the number of entries in the leave book
2. Press "enter" on your keyboard and you should see the leave record removed from HRMate.

### Importing/Exporting employee records
It's painful having to add in each employee into HRMate manually. That's why HRMate provides import and export commands,
so you can bring in all your records from Excel with just a single command!

With the import and export commands, HRMate can read and save files in [CSV](#glossary) format, which is supported
by major spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel. 


#### Importing employee records : `import`

Here's how you can bring over your records from Excel:

1. Export your Excel save file in CSV format. Ensure that the separator is set to be a semicolon(`;`), and that you have
the following fields: Name, Phone, Email, Address. You may also include a Tags column if you wish.
   * You may skip this step if you already have a CSV file (e.g. you are importing a previously exported CSV file generated by
   HRMate)
2. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `import`
3. In the file dialog that opens up, go to where you saved your exported CSV file, click on it, and click on the Open button.
4. You should see your employee records show up in HRMate, along with the message "Employee records have been imported from [your file name]!"

Here are some possible error messages you might encounter and here's how you can fix them:

| Error Message                                                       | Why it happens                                                               | Fix                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Employee records were not imported                                  | You did not select a file in the file dialog                                 | Retype the command, and make sure to select a CSV file when the file dialog opens |
| Records in file [file name] could not be imported, import cancelled | Your file likely contains illegal characters or is corrupted                 | Ensure that your data fulfils the following constraints (to be added)             |
| No valid records found in file [file name], import cancelled        | Your file either is empty or does not contain a single valid employee record | Ensure that your file is non-empty and fulfils the abovementioned constraints     |                                                     


#### Exporting employee records : `export`

Not only can you bring your data into HRMate, you can also bring your data out of HRMate. HRMate's export feature allows you
to export either the entire set of employee records, or employee records with a particular filter applied (e.g. only export
all full-time employees, which are tagged with "Full time"). You can then either store your exported CSV file for future use,
open it in a different application, or send it to another employee for them to import!

Here's how you can export your data out of HRMate:

1. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `export [file name]`, replacing `[file name]` with the name
you will like to give your file. Your files will be saved in CSV format automatically.
   - For instance, if you would like to save your file as  `employees.csv`, type in the command `export employees`
2. You should see the message "Employee records have been saved to [file name]!"
3. To retrieve your exported file, go to the folder in which HRMate is stored in your File Explorer (if using Windows) or
Finder (if using Mac OS). From there, click on the `export` folder.
4. You should see your file in the `export` folder.

Here are potential error messages that you may receive and here's how to fix them:

| Error Message                                                       | Why it happens                                   | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Employee records could not be saved!                                | You do not have the permission to write the file | Try renaming your file name when typing out the command, especially if the previous name refers to an existing file. If not, move HRMate to a different folder where you can create files, and run the command again. |      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Importing/Exporting leave records
The import and export feature extends to importing and exporting leaves. This allows you to generate lists of leave
applications that can be opened in other major spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel.


#### Importing employee records : `import-leave`

Here's how you can bring over your leave records from Excel:

1. Export your Excel save file in CSV format. Ensure that the separator is set to be a semicolon(`;`), and that you have
   the following fields: Title, Employee, Start, End, Description, Status.
  * You may skip this step if you already have a CSV file (e.g. you are importing a previously exported CSV file generated by
    HRMate)
2. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `import-leave`
3. In the file dialog that opens up, go to where you saved your exported CSV file, click on it, and click on the Open button.
4. You should see your leave records show up in HRMate, along with the message "Leave records have been imported from [your file name]!"

Here are some possible error messages you might encounter and here's how you can fix them:

#### Exporting leave records : `export-leave`

Not only can you bring your data into HRMate, you can also bring your data out of HRMate. HRMate's export feature allows you
to export either the entire set of leave application records, or leave records with a particular filter applied (e.g. only export
all leaves in a given time period). You can then either store your exported CSV file for future use,
open it in a different application, or send it to another employee for them to import!

Here's how you can export your data out of HRMate:

1. In HRMate, type in the following command in the command box: `export-leave [file name]`, replacing `[file name]` with the name
   you will like to give your file. Your files will be saved in CSV format automatically.
  - For instance, if you would like to save your file as  `today.csv`, type in the command `export today`
2. You should see the message "Leave records have been saved to [file name]!"
3. To retrieve your exported file, go to the folder in which HRMate is stored in your File Explorer (if using Windows) or
   Finder (if using Mac OS). From there, click on the `export` folder.
4. You should see your file in the `export` folder.

Here are potential error messages that you may receive and here's how to fix them:

| Leave records could not be saved! | You do not have the permission to write the file | Try renaming your file name when typing out the command, especially if the previous name refers to an existing file. If not, move HRMate to a different folder where you can create files, and run the command again. |      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Saving the data

HRMate data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HRMate data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/hrmate.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

* **Warning:**
  <box type="warning" seamless>
    If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HRMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HRMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
